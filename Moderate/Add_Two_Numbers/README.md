# Linked List Sum

This repository contains a Python implementation of a function to add two numbers represented as linked lists. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. The function returns the sum as a linked list.

## Problem Statement

Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, the digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### Example

Input:
```plaintext
l1 = [2, 4, 3]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]
```
Output:
```plaintext
[7, 0, 8]
```
Explanation:
The numbers represented are 342 and 465. Their sum is 807, which is returned as `[7, 0, 8]`
