# WeLearn

WeLearn is my personal repository where I store the DSA-related and LeetCode problems I solve. This repository is purely for learning purposes, and I aim to improve my problem-solving skills as I progress.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository contains:

1. **A README file**: This explains how I approached and solved the problem.
2. **A Python file**: This contains the implementation of the solution.

## Note

This repository reflects my personal learning journey. If you notice any errors or have suggestions, please share them! Your feedback will help me grow and improve.
